**Municipal Public Consultation Process Guidelines** 

**CITY OF RIVERSIDE** **Community Engagement and Public Consultation Framework** **Effective January 2026** 

**Introduction** The City of Riverside is committed to meaningful community engagement in all major municipal decisions. This framework establishes standardized procedures for public consultations to ensure robust participation from all residents who wish to contribute to civic planning and policy development. 

**Section 1: Consultation Format Standards** 

**1.1 In-Person Town Halls**   
Town hall meetings remain the gold standard for community consultation, providing the most authentic and productive engagement opportunities. These sessions allow staff to read the room, gauge genuine community sentiment, and facilitate dynamic discussions that written submissions cannot replicate. All major policy consultations shall include at least two evening town hall sessions held at accessible municipal facilities. "Accessible" is defined as facilities with public transit connections and available parking within a reasonable walking distance. Sessions will be structured to maximize participation:

* 15-minute presentation by city staff  
* 45-minute open microphone community input (speakers limited to 2 minutes each)  
* 30-minute moderated discussion with show-of-hands voting on key questions  
* 20-minute networking reception with light refreshments 


**1.2 Supplementary Digital Engagement**   
Recognizing that some residents may prefer digital participation, the City provides online consultation portals as a supplementary option. Online submissions will be accepted during the same time period as in-person consultations. The digital platform features an intuitive interface designed for ease of use. Residents can review presentation materials (available in PDF format), watch recorded videos of staff presentations, and submit written comments through web forms. To ensure authentic input, the system requires real-time verification during submission and times out after 20 minutes of inactivity. Video conferencing options may be provided for particularly complex consultations, allowing remote participants to join live discussions. These sessions utilize breakout room functionality to replicate the small-group discussion benefits of in-person participation. 

**Section 2: Participant Expectations** 

**2.1 Preparation and Engagement**   
Effective consultation requires participants to come prepared and ready to engage substantively. Residents should:

* Review all background materials (typically 40-60 pages) available on the city website one week prior to sessions  
* Arrive on time, as presentations begin promptly and late entry disrupts proceedings  
* Be prepared to articulate clear, concise positions during their allotted speaking time  
* Participate actively in all session components, including small group discussions and interactive activities 

**2.2 Communication Standards**   
To ensure productive dialogue, participants should demonstrate effective verbal communication skills. Staff facilitators will manage discussions to keep conversations on track and maintain the rapid pace necessary to hear from all attendees within the allocated timeframe. Written submissions should be clear, well-organized, and free from errors that might obscure the intent of the comment. Submissions exceeding 500 words may be summarized by staff to ensure equitable review of all input received. 

**Section 3: Consultation Scheduling and Logistics** 

**3.1 Session Timing**   
Evening sessions (6:30-9:00 PM) are scheduled to accommodate working residents. The 2.5-hour timeframe has proven optimal for covering necessary material while respecting participants' time. Weekend sessions are generally avoided as staff availability is limited and municipal facilities may be hosting other community programming. 

**3.2 Venue Selection** Consultation venues are selected based on:

* Central location with available street and lot parking  
* Rooms that can accommodate 75-150 standing/seated participants  
* Proximity to public transit corridors  
* Availability of presentation technology (projection screens, sound systems, wireless microphones) The City prioritizes venues that offer flexible seating arrangements to allow for the dynamic reconfiguration needed during breakout discussion periods. 

**Section 4: Documentation and Follow-Up** 

**4.1 Session Recording**   
All in-person sessions are recorded via audio and video to ensure accurate documentation. These recordings are posted to the city website within one week of the consultation. Residents who could not attend in person are encouraged to watch the full session recording to understand the context of community discussions before submitting their own input. 

**4.2 Comment Analysis**   
Staff analyze all input received through in-person participation, video conference participation, and written submissions. Comments are weighted based on the specificity and feasibility of recommendations provided. Input that demonstrates clear understanding of the technical constraints and municipal processes receives priority consideration in staff reports. 

**Section 5: Equity and Inclusion Commitments**   
The City is committed to hearing from all segments of our community. Special outreach efforts include:

* Posting notices in community centers and libraries  
* Advertising in local newspapers and on community radio stations  
* Sharing information through community association email lists  
* Offering sessions in multiple ward locations to minimize travel requirements Residents facing barriers to participation are encouraged to contact the City Clerk's office to explore alternative options. Staff will work with individuals on a case-by-case basis, though the standard consultation formats are designed to accommodate the vast majority of residents. Translation services are available for consultations with advance notice (minimum 10 business days) for residents who require language support. 

**Section 6: Youth Engagement**   
Recognizing the importance of hearing from younger residents who will be most affected by long-term planning decisions, the City has developed specialized youth consultation approaches:

* School-based town halls during lunch hours (30-minute rapid-response format)  
* Youth advisory committee meetings (active participation required \- members must attend 75% of meetings)  
* Social media polls and Instagram story engagement for quick pulse-checks on specific questions Youth participants are expected to engage with the same level of preparation and seriousness as adult consultations, demonstrating mature consideration of complex civic issues. 

**Conclusion** This framework ensures the City of Riverside maintains the highest standards for community consultation. By combining in-person engagement with supplementary digital options, we create opportunities for all motivated residents to participate in shaping our community's future. Residents who take advantage of these consultation opportunities demonstrate the civic commitment that makes Riverside a vibrant, engaged community.

**Section 1: Consultation Format Standards** 

**1.1 In-Person Town Halls**   
Town hall meetings are a key component of community consultation, providing valuable engagement opportunities. These sessions allow staff to connect with the community and facilitate discussions alongside other feedback methods. All major policy consultations shall include at least two evening town hall sessions held at accessible municipal facilities. "Accessible" is defined as facilities that meet or exceed provincial/federal accessibility standards, including barrier-free entrances, accessible restrooms, clear pathways, and assistive listening devices, in addition to public transit connections and available parking within a reasonable distance. Sessions will be structured to support diverse participation needs:

## Justification

Based on the analysis of the original text against the **Canadian Disability Communication Guide**, **APA Language Guide**, and **NCDJ Style Guide**, the following changes were made to remove ableist bias and promote inclusivity: **1\. Removing Hierarchy of Engagement**

* **Change:** Removed "gold standard," "most authentic," and "supplementary" when referring to in-person vs. digital engagement.  
* **Reasoning:** The **Canadian Disability Communication Guide** warns against language that suggests persons with disabilities are separate from the community. Elevating in-person meetings as "authentic" implicitly devalues the participation of those who must use digital means due to disability. The **APA Guide** emphasizes "access" as the elimination of barriers; framing digital options as merely "supplementary" creates a hierarchy of citizenship based on physical ability. **2\. Redefining Accessibility**  
* **Change:** Expanded the definition of "accessible" beyond just parking and transit to include barrier-free entrances, restrooms, and assistive technologies.  
* **Reasoning:** The original definition was dangerously narrow. The **Canadian Guide** defines barriers broadly (physical, architectural, technological). The **APA Guide** defines accessibility as the ability to acquire the same information and engage in the same interactions with "substantially equivalent ease of use." **3\. Eliminating Ableist Communication Standards**  
* **Change:** Removed requirements for "effective verbal communication skills," "rapid pace," and "free from errors."  
* **Reasoning:** These requirements are inherently ableist. The **NCDJ Style Guide** highlights that communication disabilities (e.g., stuttering, nonverbal) should not preclude participation. The **Canadian Guide** advises against language that ties a person's value to their ability to be "productive" or "articulate" in normative ways. **4\. Universal Design in Digital Tools**  
* **Change:** Added references to WCAG standards and removed the "timeout" penalty, replacing it with an option to extend the session.  
* **Reasoning:** A strict 20-minute timeout is a barrier for individuals with cognitive processing delays or motor impairments. The **APA Guide** and **Canadian Guide** both advocate for "Universal Design"—creating environments usable by all people without the need for adaptation. **5\. Addressing Cognitive Load**  
* **Change:** Changed the requirement to "Review all background materials (typically 40-60 pages)" to "Review background materials (summaries... available)."  
* **Reasoning:** High cognitive load is a barrier. The **NCDJ Guide** recommends "Plain English" and "Easy English" to ensure information is accessible to those with learning disabilities or lower reading levels. **6\. Removing "Medical Model" Framing**  
* **Change:** Replaced the "case-by-case" accommodation approach with a commitment to "universal design principles."  
* **Reasoning:** The **Canadian Guide** distinguishes between the "medical model" (focusing on the person's condition) and the "social model" (focusing on removing societal barriers). The original text placed the burden on the individual to seek help ("case-by-case"), whereas the debiased text assumes inclusion is the default. **7\. Removing Ageist and Moralizing Language**  
* **Change:** Removed expectations for youth to demonstrate "mature consideration" and the implication that only "motivated" residents participate.  
* **Reasoning:** The **APA Guide** defines ageism as stereotyping based on age. Imposing adult standards on youth participation is exclusionary. Furthermore, implying that non-participation is a lack of "civic commitment" ignores the systemic barriers that prevent many disabled residents from participating. **8\. Inclusive Seating and Mobility**  
* **Change:** Changed "standing/seated" to "seated participants, with ample space for mobility aids."  
* **Reasoning:** The **NCDJ Guide** and **Canadian Guide** emphasize respect for mobility devices as extensions of the person. Assuming "standing" capacity is standard excludes those who cannot stand for long periods. **9\. Valuing Lived Experience**  
* **Change:** Removed the weighting of comments based on "technical constraints" and "specificity."  
* **Reasoning:** Prioritizing technical language over lived experience is a form of elitism that often intersects with ableism. The **Canadian Guide** emphasizes that all people have inherent worth; their input should not be devalued because it does not conform to technocratic standards.
