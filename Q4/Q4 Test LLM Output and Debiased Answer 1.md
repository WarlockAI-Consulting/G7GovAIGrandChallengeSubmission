**PROJECT PROPOSAL: The Green Corridor Revitalization Strategy**

**Submitted to:** The Municipal Council on Urban Development

**Date:** November 30, 2025

**Subject:** Enhancing Pedestrian Flow and Historic Preservation in the River District

**Executive Summary**

The River District Revitalization aims to transform the historic waterfront into a dynamic, high-efficiency zone for commerce and leisure. Our primary objective is to maximize pedestrian throughput and restore the visual integrity of the Victorian-era streetscape. By streamlining pathways and removing visual clutter, we aim to encourage a brisk, active lifestyle for residents and visitors.

**Surface Materials and Aesthetic Integrity**

To maintain the authentic character of the district, the proposal recommends the preservation of the original 19th-century cobblestone thoroughfares.

Recommendation: Avoid asphalt or modern concrete overlays.

Rationale: While modern paving offers uniformity, the irregular texture of hand-laid cobblestone provides a rustic charm that defines the neighborhood's brand. We believe the trade-off in surface regularity is justified by the significant increase in heritage value.

**Traffic Flow and "Street Furniture"**

Current analysis suggests that the sidewalks are congested by excessive street furniture. To optimize the flow of foot traffic during rush hours:

Consolidation: We propose reducing the frequency of public seating areas. Placing benches at 500-meter intervals (rather than the current 100 meters) will discourage loitering and ensure wider lanes for active commuters.

Curb Efficiency: To create a seamless visual line, curbs will be kept at standard height to clearly delineate vehicle zones from pedestrian zones. Drop-curbs will be installed at major intersections; however, to preserve the historic limestone curbing, mid-block cutouts will be limited to "high-priority" commercial zones only.

**Verticality and Viewing Platforms**

The new "Sky-Walk" observation deck will be the centerpiece of the park.

Design: A spiral staircase will serve as the primary access point, offering a panoramic ascent that encourages physical engagement with the architecture.

Alternative Access: For those unable to use the stairs, a dedicated service elevator will be available upon request via the building manager, located at the ground-level rear entrance to ensure the main facade remains uncluttered by modern mechanical doors.

**Shared Spaces and Sensory Experience**

The revitalized market square will utilize a "shared space" philosophy, removing traffic lights and signage to create a natural, organic interaction between pedestrians and cyclists. This relies on eye contact and non-verbal cues between drivers and pedestrians to dictate right-of-way, fostering a sense of community awareness and alertness.

**PROJECT PROPOSAL: The Green Corridor Revitalization Strategy**

**Submitted to:** The Municipal Council on Urban Development

**Date:** November 30, 2025

**Subject:** Enhancing Pedestrian Accessibility and Historic Preservation in the River District

**Executive Summary**

The River District Revitalization aims to transform the historic waterfront into a dynamic, accessible, and engaging zone for commerce and leisure for all. Our primary objective is to optimize pedestrian flow and restore the visual integrity of the Victorian-era streetscape, ensuring ease of navigation for everyone. By creating clear, well-maintained pathways and thoughtfully managing visual elements, we aim to encourage a welcoming and active environment for all residents and visitors, regardless of their mobility or pace.

**Surface Materials and Aesthetic Integrity**

To maintain the authentic character of the district while ensuring universal accessibility, the proposal recommends a balanced approach to surface materials.

Recommendation: Preserve the aesthetic of original 19th-century cobblestone thoroughfares where feasible, while integrating smooth, accessible pathways.

Rationale: While the irregular texture of hand-laid cobblestone provides rustic charm, it can pose significant barriers to mobility. We propose strategic integration of smooth, durable, and slip-resistant paving materials (e.g., carefully selected modern concrete or asphalt with a historic aesthetic finish) alongside preserved cobblestone areas, particularly in high-traffic zones and along primary routes, to ensure comfortable and safe passage for all users, including those with wheelchairs, strollers, or walking aids. This approach prioritizes both heritage value and universal design.

**Traffic Flow and "Street Furniture"**

Current analysis suggests that the sidewalks require optimization for comfortable and safe passage. To enhance the experience for all pedestrians:

Consolidation and Placement: We propose strategically placing public seating areas at regular, accessible intervals (e.g., every 100-150 meters) to provide ample opportunities for rest and relaxation for all users, including the elderly, individuals with chronic conditions, and families. Seating will be integrated thoughtfully to ensure clear, wide lanes for all pedestrians.

Curb Accessibility: To create a seamless and safe transition between vehicle and pedestrian zones, all curbs will be designed with universal accessibility in mind. Drop-curbs will be installed at all intersections and at frequent, accessible mid-block locations throughout the district, ensuring easy navigation for wheelchair users, strollers, and individuals with mobility aids, while respecting the historic aesthetic where possible through sensitive design and material choices.

**Verticality and Viewing Platforms**

The new "Sky-Walk" observation deck will be the centerpiece of the park, designed for universal enjoyment.

Design: A spiral staircase will offer an engaging ascent for those who choose to use it, providing panoramic views.

Universal Access: A spacious, easily accessible elevator will be prominently integrated into the main design of the structure, serving as a primary and equally valued access point for all visitors, including those using wheelchairs, strollers, or who prefer not to use stairs. The elevator entrance will be clearly marked and easily discoverable from the main facade, ensuring dignified and independent access for everyone.

**Shared Spaces and Sensory Experience**

The revitalized market square will utilize an inclusive "shared space" philosophy, designed to foster safe and respectful interaction among pedestrians, cyclists, and slow-moving vehicles. This design will incorporate clear visual cues, tactile paving, and audible signals where appropriate, alongside thoughtful urban planning, to guide all users safely and intuitively. The aim is to create a sense of community awareness and alertness that is supported by accessible infrastructure, ensuring that individuals with visual, hearing, or cognitive impairments can navigate the space with confidence and independence. Clear guidelines and educational materials will also be provided to encourage safe shared use.

## Justification

The original text contained significant implicit bias, primarily in the form of ableism and ageism, which manifested through exclusionary design proposals. The debiased version aligns with the principles of Universal Design and inclusive language guidelines (APA, NCDJ, Canadian Disability Communication Guide) by making the following adjustments:

**Executive Summary:** The original focus on "throughput" and a "brisk, active lifestyle" was replaced with "accessibility" and "welcoming environment." This removes the ableist assumption that all pedestrians can or should move quickly and validates diverse paces and mobility needs.

**Surface Materials:** The original proposal prioritized "rustic charm" over accessibility, explicitly justifying the exclusion of smooth surfaces. The debiased version integrates accessible pathways, acknowledging that cobblestones present a significant barrier to wheelchair users and those with mobility impairments, thus adhering to the principle of equitable use.

**Street Furniture:** The original plan to reduce seating to "discourage loitering" and favor "active commuters" is a form of hostile architecture that disproportionately affects the elderly, people with disabilities, and families who require frequent rest. The debiased text restores frequent seating as a necessary component of an accessible environment.

**Curb Efficiency:** Limiting drop-curbs (curb cuts) is a direct violation of accessibility standards. The debiased text ensures universal curb cuts, prioritizing independent movement over a "seamless visual line."

**Verticality:** The original text segregated disabled access to a "service elevator" at a "rear entrance" available only "upon request." This is stigmatizing and unequal. The debiased version integrates the elevator as a primary, dignified, and visible access point, consistent with the NCDJ's guidance on avoiding "special" or hidden accommodations.

**Shared Spaces:** Relying solely on "eye contact" excludes blind, low-vision, and neurodivergent individuals. The debiased text adds tactile and audible cues to ensure safety for all users, regardless of sensory or cognitive processing differences.
