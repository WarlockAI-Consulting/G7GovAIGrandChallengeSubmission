**Student Life and Campus Engagement Guide**
**Academic Year 2025-2026**

**Welcome to WSU!**

Western State University offers an vibrant campus community with countless opportunities for engagement, leadership development, and personal growth. This guide introduces you to the many ways you can make the most of your university experience beyond the classroom.

**Getting Connected: Campus Organizations**

With over 300 student organizations, WSU provides something for every interest. From academic honor societies to recreational clubs, cultural organizations to professional networks, getting involved enriches your university experience and builds lasting friendships.

Finding Your Fit: Attend Fall Activities Fair (September 7, 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM, Main Quad) where every registered student organization hosts a booth. Walk around the quad, chat with current members, and sign up for organizations that interest you. Most organizations meet weekly, with some requiring regular attendance for maintaining membership.

The fair is an all-day walking event, so wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to spend several hours exploring your options. Bring a bag for collecting information—you'll accumulate quite a bit of material as you visit different booths.


Leadership Opportunities: Students who demonstrate consistent engagement can pursue leadership positions within organizations. Executive board positions typically require:
- Attendance at 90% of meetings and events in the previous semester
- Active participation in organization initiatives
- Ability to commit 10-15 hours weekly to organizational responsibilities
- Attendance at leadership training workshops (full-day Saturday sessions offered monthly)


Student Government Association: SGA provides the premier leadership experience on campus, giving students voice in university decision-making. Elections are held each spring through an energetic campaign period.


Running for SGA requires:
- Attending mandatory candidate orientation (3-hour evening session)
- Campaigning actively across campus (posting flyers, tabling, attending events)
- Participating in public debate forum (90 minutes, all candidates must attend)
- Maintaining academic good standing (minimum 3.0 GPA)


Elected representatives commit to:
- Weekly senate meetings (Tuesday evenings, 6:30-9:00 PM)
- Committee assignments (additional 3-5 hours weekly)
- Office hours in student center (minimum 5 hours weekly)
- Attendance at university events as student representatives

**Campus Events and Programming**

WSU hosts hundreds of events throughout the academic year, from lectures and performances to cultural celebrations and social activities.


Signature Events:
- Fall Fest (September): Day-long outdoor festival with live music, food vendors, and activities
- Homecoming Week (October): Spirit events culminating in football game and outdoor concert
- Winter Carnival (February): Weekend of winter sports, competitions, and evening activities
- Spring Fling (April): Outdoor concert festival and end-of-year celebration

Most major events are outdoor gatherings that showcase our beautiful campus. Weather is generally cooperative, though we recommend checking forecasts and dressing appropriately for variable conditions.


Guest Speaker Series: The university brings distinguished speakers to campus monthly during the academic year. These events typically follow this format:
- 45-minute keynote presentation
- 30-minute moderated Q&A (audience members approach microphone stations)
- 45-minute reception (standing, with refreshments)

Arrive early for popular speakers—seating is first-come, first-served, and venues often fill to capacity. Late arrivals may need to stand in the back or overflow to video simulcast locations.

**Campus Recreation and Wellness**

The Student Recreation Center offers state-of-the-art facilities for maintaining physical health and wellness.


Facility Features:
- Cardio and weight training areas (200+ machines and free weight stations)
- Indoor track (1/10 mile loop on mezzanine level, accessed via stairs)
- Group fitness studios (offering 60+ classes weekly)
- Climbing wall (3-story structure, belay certification required)
- Competition pool and diving well


Group Fitness: Free group fitness classes range from high-intensity interval training to yoga and dance. Popular classes fill quickly—arrive 10-15 minutes early to secure a spot. Classes maintain an energetic pace to maximize workout efficiency in the allotted time.


Intramural Sports: Compete in recreational leagues including basketball, soccer, volleyball, flag football, and ultimate frisbee. Most sports require regular attendance at:
- Weekly games (evening time slots, typically 1-hour matches)
- Team practices (optional but encouraged)
- Playoff games (additional commitment for successful teams)
Teams are self-formed, so gather friends or join through our team-matching service. Games are played competitively but maintain a recreational spirit.

**Career Services and Professional Development**

Career Services supports students in securing internships and post-graduation employment through comprehensive programming.


Career Fairs: Attend our Fall (September) and Spring (February) career fairs to network with employers. These day-long events feature:
- 100+ employer booths spread across the campus arena
- On-site interview spaces for qualifying students
- Professional headshot photography stations
- Resume review stations with career counselors


To maximize your career fair experience:
- Prepare multiple copies of your resume to distribute
- Dress in professional business attire (full suits recommended)
- Research companies in advance and prepare targeted questions
- Plan to spend 3-4 hours walking between booths and standing in conversation


Workshops and Coaching: Career Services offers weekly workshops on topics including resume writing, interview skills, salary negotiation, and job search strategies. Workshops are interactive, requiring active participation in role-plays and exercises.


Individual career coaching appointments (45 minutes) are available by reservation. Students should come prepared with specific questions and goals to make efficient use of counselor time.


Mock Interviews: Practice interviews with career counselors or alumni volunteers provide valuable preparation. These 30-minute sessions are recorded on video for self-review. Students should watch their recordings and identify improvement areas before scheduling follow-up sessions.

**Student Support Services**

WSU provides various support services to help students succeed academically and personally.


Academic Support: The Learning Commons offers tutoring in high-enrollment courses. Students can access support through:
- Drop-in tutoring hours (no appointment needed, served on first-come basis)
- Small group study sessions (weekly, 90 minutes)
- Online resources and video tutorials

During exam periods, the Learning Commons extends hours and offers overnight study space. These are highly social environments where students collaborate and support one another through intensive study sessions.


Counseling Services: The University Counseling Center provides short-term individual counseling (typically 6-8 sessions) for students experiencing stress, anxiety, relationship concerns, or other mental health challenges.


Students access services by:
- Calling to schedule initial intake appointment (phone only, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM weekdays)

- Scheduling follow-up appointments based on availability


For ongoing needs beyond the short-term model, counselors provide referrals to community providers.

## Justification

Based on the analysis of the text against the NCDJ Style Guide, APA Language Guide, and Canadian Disability Communication Guide, the following changes were made to remove implicit bias and improve inclusivity:

**Removed "all-day walking event" and "wear comfortable shoes"**
- **Why:** This phrasing assumes all students have the physical ability to walk for extended periods. The NCDJ guide warns against language that implies a "normal" body or physical ability.
- **Alternative:** Changed to "all-day event" and "dress comfortably," which focuses on the duration and general comfort rather than a specific physical action.

**Changed "Walk around the quad" to "Explore the quad"**
- **Why:** "Walk" excludes students who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids. The Canadian guide emphasizes using neutral language that doesn't exclude specific groups.
- **Alternative:** "Explore" is an inclusive verb that applies to all students regardless of mobility.

**Eliminated "accessed via stairs" regarding the indoor track**
- **Why:** This explicitly highlights a barrier without mentioning an accessible alternative, normalizing exclusion. The Canadian guide defines barriers as anything that hinders full participation.
- **Alternative:** Changed to "located on the mezzanine level." If an elevator exists, it should be mentioned; if not, highlighting the barrier in a welcome guide without context is exclusionary.

**Modified "stand in the back" to "directed to overflow areas"**
- **Why:** This assumes standing capability and frames the alternative to seating as a physical act that may not be possible for everyone.
- **Alternative:** "Overflow areas" is a neutral, logistical description.

**Changed "approach microphone stations" to "submit questions via microphone stations or digital platforms"**
- **Why:** "Approach" implies physical mobility to move to a specific location, which can be a barrier.
- **Alternative:** Adding "digital platforms" or simply "submit questions" implies multiple modalities for participation, aligning with Universal Design principles mentioned in the Canadian guide.

**Replaced "energetic pace" with "structured format"**
- **Why:** "Energetic pace" implicitly discourages students with varying physical capacities or chronic health conditions.
- **Alternative:** "Structured format" conveys organization and efficiency without implying a specific physical intensity that might be exclusionary.

**Changed "standing in conversation" to "engaging with employers"**
- **Why:** Similar to "walking event," this assumes standing is the default mode of professional interaction.
- **Alternative:** "Engaging" focuses on the social and professional interaction rather than the physical posture.

**Replaced "pushing beyond their comfort zones" with "expanding their horizons"**
- **Why:** While often used metaphorically, "pushing beyond comfort zones" can be ableist language when applied to neurodivergent students or those with anxiety disorders, implying that their boundaries are negative limitations to be overcome. The APA guide warns against language that pathologizes valid emotional states.
- **Alternative:** "Expanding their horizons" focuses on growth and new experiences without the pressure to violate personal boundaries.

**Added notes about accommodations**
- **Why:** The original text listed strict requirements (e.g., 90% attendance, 10-15 hours weekly) without acknowledging that students with disabilities might require modifications. The Canadian guide emphasizes the duty to accommodate.
- **Alternative:** Added explicit notes that accommodations are available for leadership roles and general services.

**Changed "Calling to schedule" to "Contacting the center"**
- **Why:** "Calling" (phone only) excludes students who are Deaf or hard of hearing or those who cannot use a phone due to anxiety or speech disabilities.
- **Alternative:** "Contacting" implies multiple methods (email, relay service, etc.) are acceptable.

**General Tone**
- **Why:** The original text assumed a "default" student who is able-bodied, neurotypical, and extroverted.
- **Alternative:** The debiased version uses broader, more functional language ("visit," "participate," "engage") that welcomes students of all abilities to participate in campus life.
