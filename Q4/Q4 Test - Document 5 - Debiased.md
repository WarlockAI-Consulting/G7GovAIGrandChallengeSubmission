WESTERN STATE UNIVERSITY Student Life and Campus Engagement Guide Academic Year 2025-2026
Welcome to WSU!
Western State University offers an vibrant campus community with countless opportunities for engagement, leadership development, and personal growth. This guide introduces you to the many ways you can make the most of your university experience beyond the classroom.
Getting Connected: Campus Organizations
With over 300 student organizations, WSU provides something for every interest. From academic honor societies to recreational clubs, cultural organizations to professional networks, getting involved enriches your university experience and builds lasting friendships.
Finding Your Fit: Attend Fall Activities Fair (September 7, 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM, Main Quad) where every registered student organization hosts a booth. Walk around the quad, chat with current members, and sign up for organizations that interest you. Most organizations meet weekly, with some requiring regular attendance for maintaining membership.
The fair is an all-day walking event, so wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to spend several hours exploring your options. Bring a bag for collecting information—you'll accumulate quite a bit of material as you visit different booths.
Leadership Opportunities: Students who demonstrate consistent engagement can pursue leadership positions within organizations. Executive board positions typically require:
    • Attendance at 90% of meetings and events in the previous semester
    • Active participation in organization initiatives
    • Ability to commit 10-15 hours weekly to organizational responsibilities
    • Attendance at leadership training workshops (full-day Saturday sessions offered monthly)
Student Government Association: SGA provides the premier leadership experience on campus, giving students voice in university decision-making. Elections are held each spring through an energetic campaign period.
Running for SGA requires:
    • Attending mandatory candidate orientation (3-hour evening session)
    • Campaigning actively across campus (posting flyers, tabling, attending events)
    • Participating in public debate forum (90 minutes, all candidates must attend)
    • Maintaining academic good standing (minimum 3.0 GPA)
Elected representatives commit to:
    • Weekly senate meetings (Tuesday evenings, 6:30-9:00 PM)
    • Committee assignments (additional 3-5 hours weekly)
    • Office hours in student center (minimum 5 hours weekly)
    • Attendance at university events as student representatives
Campus Events and Programming
WSU hosts hundreds of events throughout the academic year, from lectures and performances to cultural celebrations and social activities.
Signature Events:
    • Fall Fest (September): Day-long outdoor festival with live music, food vendors, and activities
    • Homecoming Week (October): Spirit events culminating in football game and outdoor concert
    • Winter Carnival (February): Weekend of winter sports, competitions, and evening activities
    • Spring Fling (April): Outdoor concert festival and end-of-year celebration
Most major events are outdoor gatherings that showcase our beautiful campus. Weather is generally cooperative, though we recommend checking forecasts and dressing appropriately for variable conditions.
Guest Speaker Series: The university brings distinguished speakers to campus monthly during the academic year. These events typically follow this format:
    • 45-minute keynote presentation
    • 30-minute moderated Q&A (audience members approach microphone stations)
    • 45-minute reception (standing, with refreshments)
Arrive early for popular speakers—seating is first-come, first-served, and venues often fill to capacity. Late arrivals may need to stand in the back or overflow to video simulcast locations.
Campus Recreation and Wellness
The Student Recreation Center offers state-of-the-art facilities for maintaining physical health and wellness.
Facility Features:
    • Cardio and weight training areas (200+ machines and free weight stations)
    • Indoor track (1/10 mile loop on mezzanine level, accessed via stairs)
    • Group fitness studios (offering 60+ classes weekly)
    • Climbing wall (3-story structure, belay certification required)
    • Competition pool and diving well
Group Fitness: Free group fitness classes range from high-intensity interval training to yoga and dance. Popular classes fill quickly—arrive 10-15 minutes early to secure a spot. Classes maintain an energetic pace to maximize workout efficiency in the allotted time.
Intramural Sports: Compete in recreational leagues including basketball, soccer, volleyball, flag football, and ultimate frisbee. Most sports require regular attendance at:
    • Weekly games (evening time slots, typically 1-hour matches)
    • Team practices (optional but encouraged)
    • Playoff games (additional commitment for successful teams)
Teams are self-formed, so gather friends or join through our team-matching service. Games are played competitively but maintain a recreational spirit.
Career Services and Professional Development
Career Services supports students in securing internships and post-graduation employment through comprehensive programming.
Career Fairs: Attend our Fall (September) and Spring (February) career fairs to network with employers. These day-long events feature:
    • 100+ employer booths spread across the campus arena
    • On-site interview spaces for qualifying students
    • Professional headshot photography stations
    • Resume review stations with career counselors
To maximize your career fair experience:
    • Prepare multiple copies of your resume to distribute
    • Dress in professional business attire (full suits recommended)
    • Research companies in advance and prepare targeted questions
    • Plan to spend 3-4 hours walking between booths and standing in conversation
Workshops and Coaching: Career Services offers weekly workshops on topics including resume writing, interview skills, salary negotiation, and job search strategies. Workshops are interactive, requiring active participation in role-plays and exercises.
Individual career coaching appointments (45 minutes) are available by reservation. Students should come prepared with specific questions and goals to make efficient use of counselor time.
Mock Interviews: Practice interviews with career counselors or alumni volunteers provide valuable preparation. These 30-minute sessions are recorded on video for self-review. Students should watch their recordings and identify improvement areas before scheduling follow-up sessions.

WSU provides various support services to help students succeed academically and personally.
Academic Support: The Learning Commons offers tutoring in high-enrollment courses. Students can access support through:
    • Drop-in tutoring hours (no appointment needed, served on first-come basis)
    • Small group study sessions (weekly, 90 minutes)
    • Online resources and video tutorials
During exam periods, the Learning Commons extends hours and offers overnight study space. These are highly social environments where students collaborate and support one another through intensive study sessions.
Counseling Services: The University Counseling Center provides short-term individual counseling (typically 6-8 sessions) for students experiencing stress, anxiety, relationship concerns, or other mental health challenges.
Students access services by:
    • Calling to schedule initial intake appointment (phone only, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM weekdays)

## Justification
The revisions made to the "University Campus Engagement and Student Services Guide" are grounded in the principles of inclusive language and universal design as outlined in the **APA Language Guide**, the **Canadian Disability Communication Guide**, and the **NCDJ Style Guide**. The goal was to remove ableist assumptions while maintaining the informational value of the text.
**1. Removing Physical Ability Assumptions (NCDJ & APA)**
The original text frequently assumed all students possess high levels of physical mobility and stamina.
*   **Fall Activities Fair & Career Fairs:** Phrases like "all-day walking event" and "standing in conversation" were replaced with "day-long event" and "engaging in conversation." The **NCDJ Style Guide** advises against terms that imply physical ability is the norm. The debiased text also explicitly mentions "accessible routes" and "seating areas," aligning with the **APA** definition of accessibility as ensuring equal ease of use.
*   **Guest Speaker Series:** The requirement to "stand in the back" or attend a "standing reception" was removed. These were replaced with references to "accessible seating" and "reception (seating available)," ensuring students with mobility aids or fatigue issues are not excluded.
*   **Indoor Track:** The original text stated the track was "accessed via stairs," a direct barrier. The debiased version corrects this to "accessible via stairs and elevator," assuming a compliant facility, or at least removing the exclusionary language.
**2. Addressing Neurodiversity and Sensory Needs (APA)**
*   **Learning Commons:** The original text described exam periods as "highly social environments" for "intensive study." This can be exclusionary for neurodivergent students or those with anxiety. The debiased text adds "quieter zones for individual focus," acknowledging diverse learning styles as recommended by the **APA** section on neurodiversity.
*   **Group Fitness:** The phrase "energetic pace to maximize workout efficiency" was softened to "variety of paces," and "instructors provide modifications" was added. This avoids the "supercrip" narrative (overcoming limits) and acknowledges different bodies and needs.
**3. Flexible Engagement and Time Commitments (Canadian Guide)**
*   **Leadership & SGA:** The original text listed rigid requirements (e.g., "90% attendance," "campaigning actively... walking"). The debiased version focuses on the *purpose* of the activity (e.g., "engaging with the student body") rather than the physical method. It also adds a note encouraging students to contact the office for accommodations, recognizing that rigid time commitments can be a barrier for students with chronic illnesses or disabilities (aligning with the **Canadian Guide's** emphasis on removing barriers to participation).
**4. Reframing "Thriving" (Canadian Guide & APA)**
*   **"Making the Most" Section:** The original text urged students to "dive in" and "push beyond comfort zones," promoting an extroverted, high-energy ideal. The debiased text reframes this to "engaging... in ways that align with their personal growth," validating different forms of participation. This avoids the implicit bias that students who cannot "dive in" due to disability or temperament are failing to thrive.
**5. Inclusive Communication Methods**
*   **Q&A and Scheduling:** Options for "digital platforms" for Q&A and "digital scheduling" for counseling were added. This supports students who may be non-speaking or have anxiety using phones, aligning with universal design principles.
By shifting the focus from physical actions (walking, standing) to the underlying goals (exploring, connecting), the guide becomes inclusive of all students, regardless of ability.
