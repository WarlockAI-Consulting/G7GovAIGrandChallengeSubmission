## Justification

Based on the analysis of the **APA Inclusive Language Guide**, the **NCDJ Style Guide**, and the **Canadian Disability Communication Guide**, the following changes were made to remove ableist language and implicit bias: **Removed "energetic" and "high-energy culture"**

* **Why:** These terms implicitly prioritize physical stamina and can exclude individuals with chronic fatigue, physical disabilities, or different neurotypes who may be highly capable but express energy differently. The **Canadian Disability Communication Guide** warns against language that ties a person's value to their ability to be "productive" in a specific, physical way.  
* **Alternative:** Replaced with "motivated" and "passion for excellence," which focus on professional attitude rather than physical output. **Eliminated "hit the ground running"**  
* **Why:** The **APA Language Guide** explicitly lists "hit the ground running" as an ableist idiom to avoid. It relies on a physical metaphor that equates professional competence with physical mobility.  
* **Alternative:** Changed to "eager to contribute immediately," which conveys the same urgency without the ableist framing. **Changed "standing room only" and "prepared to stand for extended periods"**  
* **Why:** These phrases create direct barriers for individuals with mobility impairments or chronic pain. The **Canadian Guide** and **APA Guide** emphasize "Universal Design" and "Accessibility," stating that environments should be usable by all people without need for adaptation. Explicitly stating "standing room only" signals exclusion.  
* **Alternative:** Modified to indicate that seating is limited but available upon request, and removed the instruction to prepare to stand, replacing it with a recommendation for comfortable footwear. **Addressed "several flights of stairs"**  
* **Why:** Highlighting stairs as the primary route without mentioning an accessible alternative (like an elevator) is a significant barrier. The **NCDJ Style Guide** and **Canadian Guide** emphasize that accessibility information is crucial. Warning about stairs without offering an alternative implies that those who cannot use stairs are not expected or welcome.  
* **Alternative:** Added information about accessible parking and elevator access, assuming a debiased event would utilize an accessible venue. **Removed "thrive under pressure" and "keep pace"**  
* **Why:** "Keep pace" is another physical metaphor that can be exclusionary. "Thrive under pressure" can disadvantage neurodivergent candidates (e.g., those with anxiety or autism) who may perform excellently in structured environments but find "pressure" to be a barrier rather than a motivator.  
* **Alternative:** Rephrased to "excel in dynamic environments" and "committed to... standards," focusing on the outcome rather than the mode of working. **Changed "rapid-fire conversations"**  
* **Why:** This phrase implies a speed of processing and speech that can exclude individuals with speech impediments, hearing loss, or processing delays. The **NCDJ Guide** advises against terms that imply a "deficit" in communication.  
* **Alternative:** "Brief, engaging conversations" maintains the context of a busy fair without setting an exclusionary standard for communication speed. **Reframed "comfortable with frequent travel..."**  
* **Why:** Stating candidates must be "comfortable" with these demands can imply that no accommodations will be made.  
* **Alternative:** Stated these as objective job requirements ("The role involves..."), which allows space for candidates to request reasonable accommodations if needed, rather than self-selecting out because they aren't "comfortable."
