## Justification
The original text contained several instances of implicit ableism and exclusionary language that have been revised based on the *APA Language Guide*, the *Canadian Disability Communication Guide*, and the *NCDJ Style Guide*.
1.  **Removal of Ableist Idioms and "Pace" Language:** Phrases like "hit the ground running," "fast-paced," and "keep pace" were removed or replaced. These idioms imply a requirement for a specific physical speed or neurotypical processing style, which can exclude individuals with physical disabilities or neurodivergence. The *APA Language Guide* advises avoiding ableist terms that denigrate disabilities or imply that a specific level of physical function is the only "normal."
2.  **Elimination of Physical Barriers:** The original text explicitly mentioned "standing room only" and "flights of stairs," creating direct barriers for individuals with mobility impairments. This violates the principles of **Universal Design** and **Accessibility** highlighted in the *Canadian Disability Communication Guide*. The revised text ensures seating is available and proactively mentions accessible parking and elevators.
3.  **Inclusive "Energy" and Culture:** References to "energetic," "high-energy culture," and "thrive under pressure" were replaced with "ambitious," "dynamic," and "collaborative." The original phrasing implicitly values a specific type of extroverted, high-stamina performance that may alienate qualified candidates with chronic health conditions, fatigue, or different working styles. The *Canadian Disability Communication Guide* warns against language that ties a person's value to a specific mode of productivity.
4.  **Communication Styles:** The phrase "rapid-fire conversations" was changed to "engaging conversations." The original term could disadvantage individuals with speech disabilities (e.g., stuttering) or processing delays, as noted in the *NCDJ Style Guide* regarding inclusive language for communication differences.
5.  **Proactive Accessibility Information:** A section on accessibility was added to explicitly invite accommodation requests. This shifts the burden from the candidate to the organizer, aligning with the *APA* and *Canadian* guides' emphasis on creating inclusive environments where accessibility is a forethought, not an afterthought.
