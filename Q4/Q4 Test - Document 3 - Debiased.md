## Justification
Based on the analysis of the **NCDJ Style Guide**, **APA Inclusive Language Guide**, and **Canadian Disability Communication Guide**, the following changes were made to remove implicit ableism and create a more inclusive job posting:
**Removed "dynamic, high-performing" and "energetic professional"**
*   **Why:** These terms are coded language that implies a specific level of physical stamina and neurotypical extroversion. The **Canadian Disability Communication Guide** warns against language that ties a person's value to their productivity or specific energy levels.
*   **Alternative:** Replaced with "experienced," "motivated," and "professional," which focus on the candidate's attitude and qualifications rather than their physical energy or personality type.
**Eliminated "stamina" and "intellectual agility"**
*   **Why:** "Stamina" is a direct reference to physical endurance, which excludes individuals with chronic illnesses or fatigue-related disabilities who may be perfectly capable of doing the intellectual work. "Intellectual agility" can be interpreted as requiring a specific speed of processing that disadvantages neurodivergent individuals. The **APA Guide** highlights how such terms can create biases around cognitive functioning.
*   **Alternative:** Replaced with "ability to manage multiple competing priorities" and "strong analytical skills," which describe the actual job requirement without prescribing the physical or cognitive method of achieving it.
**Reframed "fast-paced," "rapid-turnaround," and "tight deadlines"**
*   **Why:** While deadlines are a reality, emphasizing "speed" and "pace" as defining features of the environment can be exclusionary to those who require more processing time or work methodically. The **NCDJ Guide** suggests avoiding language that implies physical ability is a prerequisite for professional competence.
*   **Alternative:** Changed to "time-sensitive analysis," "within established timelines," and "tight timelines," focusing on the *requirement* (meeting the deadline) rather than the *pace* (fast).
**Modified "in-person relationship building"**
*   **Why:** This explicitly excludes individuals who may need to build relationships remotely due to mobility issues, immune compromise, or other disabilities.
*   **Alternative:** "Relationship building," allowing for various methods of connection.
**Removed "thrives in high-pressure situations" and "resilient under stress"**
*   **Why:** These phrases pathologize the reaction to stress and imply that "resilience" (often interpreted as stoicism or lack of visible struggle) is a required personality trait. This can disadvantage neurodivergent individuals or those with mental health conditions. The **APA Guide** warns against language that stereotypes or stigmatizes mental health responses.
*   **Alternative:** "Works effectively in time-sensitive situations" and "Maintains work quality during peak periods." This focuses on the *outcome* (work quality) rather than the internal emotional state (thriving/resilience).
**Changed "open-concept office environment" framing**
*   **Why:** The original text listed being "comfortable" in an open-concept office as a competency. Open offices are significant barriers for many neurodivergent people (e.g., autism, ADHD). Framing comfort here as a requirement is discriminatory.
*   **Alternative:** Described the environment neutrally ("collaborative workspace") and immediately mentioned "quiet spaces and flexible arrangements," aligning with the **Canadian Guide's** emphasis on universal design and removing barriers.
**Adjusted "Assessment Process"**
*   **Why:** The original text listed strict time limits (3 hours) without immediate mention of accommodation, which can deter candidates from applying.
*   **Alternative:** Added "standard duration 3 hours; adjustable for accommodation" directly into the line item, and moved the general accommodation statement to the top of the section to be proactive rather than reactive.
**General Terminology Changes**
*   **Why:** Terms like "exceptional," "superior," and "meticulous" can set an exclusionary bar that implies perfectionism often unattainable for those with certain learning disabilities, even if their work is high quality.
*   **Alternative:** Used "strong," "effective," and "high-quality," which are measurable and inclusive standards of performance.
