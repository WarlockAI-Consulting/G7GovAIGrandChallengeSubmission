## Justification
The revisions to the job posting were made to eliminate implicit ableism and foster inclusivity, adhering to principles from the **APA Language Guide**, **Canadian Disability Communication Guide**, and **NCDJ Style Guide**.
**1. Removing "Supercrip" and Neurotypical Norms:**
*   **Issue:** Terms like "energetic," "stamina," "thrives in high-pressure," and "resilient under stress" imply a specific physiological and emotional response to work that excludes individuals with chronic health conditions, fatigue, or different stress responses.
*   **Rectification:** These were replaced with outcome-focused language such as "dedicated," "adaptability," "works effectively in demanding situations," and "maintains consistent performance." This shifts the focus from *how* the person feels or physically endures to *what* they achieve.
**2. Addressing Cognitive and Sensory Biases:**
*   **Issue:** Phrases like "intellectual agility," "synthesize... quickly," "real-time discussions," and "maintaining focus despite frequent interruptions" optimize for neurotypical processing speeds and styles. They disadvantage neurodivergent candidates who may produce high-quality work but require different processing time or environments.
*   **Rectification:** "Quickly" was changed to "effectively," "real-time" was removed to allow for thoughtful contribution, and "interruptions" was reframed as "dynamic environment." The "open-concept" environment description was modified to acknowledge the need for diverse sensory supports.
**3. Inclusive Communication and Physical Requirements:**
*   **Issue:** "Verbal presentation," "active listening," and "standing attendance" create barriers for individuals with speech, hearing, or mobility disabilities.
*   **Rectification:** "Verbal" was removed to allow for interpreters or AAC devices. "Active listening" was broadened to "effective listening and comprehension." "Standing attendance" (likely a metaphor for recurring meetings) was clarified to "attendance expected" to avoid the literal physical requirement.
**4. Flexibility and Accommodation:**
*   **Issue:** Rigid requirements for "in-person presence," "travel," and a strict "10-day notice" for accommodations place an undue burden on candidates with disabilities.
*   **Rectification:** Travel and extended hours requirements were immediately paired with statements about accommodations. The "strong preference for in-office presence" was balanced with a commitment to flexible work arrangements. The accommodation notice period was softened to encourage early contact while remaining flexible for emerging needs.
**5. Assessment Process:**
*   **Issue:** Testing "under pressure" and "replicating actual working conditions" (which were biased) reinforces the exclusion of candidates who need accommodations to demonstrate their true skill level.
*   **Rectification:** The assessment description now explicitly mentions "accessible work simulation" and "equitable participation," focusing on skill assessment rather than speed or pressure tolerance.
