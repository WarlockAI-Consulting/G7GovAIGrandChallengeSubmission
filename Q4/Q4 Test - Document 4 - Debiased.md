STATE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY "BE READY" - Personal Emergency Preparedness Guide Protecting Yourself and Your Family During Emergencies
Introduction: Why Preparedness Matters
Natural disasters and emergencies can strike without warning. From hurricanes and floods to winter storms and power outages, our state faces various threats that can disrupt normal life for days or even weeks. The difference between those who weather emergencies successfully and those who struggle often comes down to one factor: preparation.
This guide provides essential information every resident needs to ensure they can respond effectively when disaster strikes. Taking the time now to prepare means you'll be ready to act decisively when seconds count.
Part 1: Building Your Emergency Kit
Every household should maintain an emergency kit capable of sustaining all members for at least 72 hours without external assistance. This means being self-sufficient while emergency responders focus on life-threatening situations and critical infrastructure restoration.
Essential Supplies:
    • Water: One gallon per person per day (3-day minimum supply)
    • Non-perishable food requiring no refrigeration or cooking
    • Manual can opener
    • Battery-powered or hand-crank radio (NOAA Weather Radio recommended)
    • Flashlights with extra batteries
    • First aid kit with comprehensive supplies
    • Prescription medications (7-day supply minimum)
    • Important documents in waterproof container (insurance policies, identification, bank records)
    • Cash in small denominations
    • Cell phone with backup charging options
Additional Recommended Items:
    • Hygiene supplies and personal sanitation items
    • Plastic sheeting and duct tape for shelter-in-place situations
    • Tools including wrench for turning off utilities
    • Bleach for water purification
    • Pet supplies if applicable
    • Entertainment items for managing stress during extended emergencies
Kit Maintenance: Review your emergency kit twice yearly (we recommend daylight saving time changes as reminders). Check expiration dates on food, water, and medications. Test batteries in all devices and replace as needed. Update documents to reflect current information.
Store your kit in an easily accessible location that all household members know. Ideally, supplies should be portable—stored in a large wheeled container or duffel bags that can be quickly moved if evacuation becomes necessary.
Part 2: Creating Your Family Emergency Plan
Having supplies is essential, but equally important is having a clear plan that everyone understands and can execute under stress.
Communication Strategy: Emergencies often disrupt local phone networks. Establish an out-of-state contact person whom all family members can call to check in and relay messages. Ensure everyone has this contact information memorized—don't rely solely on cell phone contacts that may be inaccessible if devices are lost or damaged.
Identify multiple ways to receive emergency alerts:
    • Sign up for local emergency notification systems (typically text and email)
    • Download your state's emergency app for real-time updates
    • Monitor local news and NOAA Weather Radio
    • Follow official social media accounts
Meeting Points: Designate two meeting locations:
    1. A spot immediately outside your home for sudden emergencies like fire
    2. A location outside your neighborhood in case you cannot return home
Choose locations everyone can walk to if necessary. Practice traveling to these locations so all family members know the route.
Evacuation Planning: Know your evacuation routes and have alternatives mapped. During actual emergencies, follow official evacuation routes—attempting shortcuts can lead you into dangerous situations or blocked roads.
Keep your vehicle at least half-full of gas during seasons when emergencies are more likely. If evacuation orders are issued, leave immediately rather than waiting until the last moment. Traffic congestion during evacuations can turn a one-hour drive into a six-hour ordeal.
If you don't have a vehicle, identify neighbors or friends who might provide transportation, or familiarize yourself with public evacuation resources in advance. Don't wait until an emergency is imminent to solve transportation challenges.
Household Drills: Practice your emergency plan at least twice yearly. Run through different scenarios:
    • Fire evacuation (everyone should be able to exit the home within 2 minutes)
    • Severe weather sheltering (everyone should know the safest interior room)
    • Communication plan testing (actually call the out-of-state contact and practice the protocol)
Include all household members in drills. Children should understand the plan appropriate to their age and be prepared to act independently if separated from adults.
Part 3: Staying Informed During Emergencies
When disaster strikes, information saves lives. However, not all information is reliable, and rumors can spread quickly during chaotic situations.
Official Information Sources:
    • Local emergency management agency (sign up for alerts in advance)
    • National Weather Service and NOAA Weather Radio
    • Local news broadcasts and official websites
    • Official social media accounts (verify you're following legitimate agency accounts)
    • Emergency Alert System broadcasts on radio and television
During emergencies, monitor these sources continuously. Conditions can change rapidly, and new threats can emerge. Keep your battery-powered or hand-crank radio readily available—don't assume internet and cellular networks will remain operational.
Attending Community Meetings: Many jurisdictions hold annual emergency preparedness fairs and community meetings. These events provide opportunities to:
    • Meet emergency management staff and first responders
    • Ask questions about local-specific risks and response plans
    • Pick up free preparedness materials
    • Participate in hands-on demonstrations
Attendance at these events demonstrates civic engagement and ensures you have the most current information about local emergency protocols. Bring household members so everyone hears information firsthand rather than through secondhand relay.
Part 4: Special Considerations
Certain situations require additional planning beyond basic preparedness.
Households with Infants or Young Children:
    • Maintain extra supplies of diapers, formula, and baby food
    • Include comfort items to manage stress during emergencies
    • Prepare to explain situations in age-appropriate terms
    • Ensure children can communicate basic information (name, address, parent contact) if separated
Pet Preparedness:
    • Assemble pet emergency kit (food, water, medications, veterinary records)
    • Research pet-friendly evacuation shelters in advance (many general shelters cannot accommodate animals)
    • Ensure pets have identification tags and are microchipped
    • Keep pets' vaccination records current and in your emergency kit
Financial Preparedness: Emergencies can disrupt banking systems and ATM networks. Maintain emergency cash reserves in small denominations. Keep photocopies of credit cards and important financial documents in your emergency kit.
Part 5: Community Resilience
Prepared communities recover faster from disasters. Your personal preparedness contributes to overall community resilience by ensuring you won't need emergency resources that could be directed to more vulnerable residents.
Getting Involved:
    • Attend local Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training
    • Participate in neighborhood preparedness groups
    • Volunteer with local emergency management during non-emergency periods
    • Share preparedness information with neighbors and coworkers
CERT training provides hands-on experience in disaster response skills including basic medical care, light search and rescue, fire safety, and disaster psychology. The program runs for 20 hours over several weeks, teaching ordinary citizens how to assist professional responders during large-scale emergencies.
Checking on Neighbors: During and after emergencies, check on elderly neighbors and those who live alone. Your quick check could make a life-saving difference. However, never put yourself in danger—if situations seem beyond your capability, contact emergency services immediately.
Conclusion: Taking Action Today
Emergency preparedness isn't complicated, but it does require commitment. Set aside time this weekend to begin building your emergency kit. Within a month, have your complete family emergency plan documented and practiced.
Don't wait for warnings to start preparing. By the time an emergency is imminent, stores will be crowded, supplies will be depleted, and you'll be making decisions under stress rather than through careful planning.
Remember: Emergency responders will prioritize life-threatening situations. Your preparedness means you can weather the initial crisis independently, allowing first responders to focus on those most in need. Every prepared household makes the entire community more resilient.
For more information, attend one of our regional preparedness workshops held quarterly at locations throughout the state. Visit our website for schedules and to register for these informative sessions.
Your safety is your responsibility. Be ready.

**Meeting Points:** Designate two meeting locations:
1.  A spot immediately outside your home for sudden emergencies like fire
2.  A location outside your neighborhood in case you cannot return home
Choose locations that are accessible to everyone in your household. Practice traveling to these locations so all family members know the route and can navigate it safely.
**Evacuation Planning:** Know your evacuation routes and have alternatives mapped. During actual emergencies, follow official evacuation routes—attempting shortcuts can lead you into dangerous situations or blocked roads.
Keep your vehicle at least half-full of gas during seasons when emergencies are more likely. If evacuation orders are issued, leave immediately rather than waiting until the last moment. Traffic congestion during evacuations can turn a one-hour drive into a six-hour ordeal.
If you do not have a vehicle or cannot drive, identify neighbors, friends, or local paratransit services that might provide transportation. Familiarize yourself with public evacuation resources in advance. Don't wait until an emergency is imminent to solve transportation challenges.
**Household Drills:** Practice your emergency plan at least twice yearly. Run through different scenarios:
*   Fire evacuation (practice exiting the home as quickly and safely as possible)
*   Severe weather sheltering (everyone should know the safest interior room)
*   Communication plan testing (actually call the out-of-state contact and practice the protocol)
Include all household members in drills. Children should understand the plan appropriate to their age. Ensure drills are adapted for members with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities so they are comfortable with the process.
**Part 3: Staying Informed During Emergencies**
When disaster strikes, information saves lives. However, not all information is reliable, and rumors can spread quickly during chaotic situations.
**Official Information Sources:**
*   Local emergency management agency (sign up for alerts in advance)
*   National Weather Service and NOAA Weather Radio
*   Local news broadcasts and official websites
*   Official social media accounts (verify you're following legitimate agency accounts)

**Households with Infants or Young Children:**
*   Maintain extra supplies of diapers, formula, and baby food
*   Include comfort items to manage stress during emergencies
*   Prepare to explain situations in age-appropriate terms
*   Ensure children can communicate basic information (name, address, parent contact) if separated
**Residents with Disabilities or Access and Functional Needs:**
*   Create a personal support network of friends, family, and neighbors who know your specific needs and can assist during an emergency.
*   If you use power-dependent medical equipment, register with your utility company and plan for backup power sources.
*   Keep a list of the model and serial numbers of your medical devices (e.g., wheelchairs, oxygen concentrators).
*   If you have a communication disability, carry a pre-printed communication card or device that explains your needs to first responders.
*   Plan for accessible transportation if evacuation is required.
**Pet and Service Animal Preparedness:**
*   Assemble an emergency kit (food, water, medications, veterinary records)
*   Research pet-friendly evacuation shelters in advance (Note: Service animals are allowed in all general population shelters by law)
*   Ensure animals have identification tags and are microchipped
*   Keep vaccination records current and in your emergency kit
**Financial Preparedness:** Emergencies can disrupt banking systems and ATM networks. Maintain emergency cash reserves in small denominations. Keep photocopies of credit cards and important financial documents in your emergency kit.
**Part 5: Community Resilience**
Prepared communities recover faster from disasters. Your personal preparedness contributes to overall community resilience by ensuring you are better positioned to manage the emergency, allowing resources to be directed to residents facing the most immediate life-safety threats or those with disproportionate barriers to response.
**Getting Involved:**
*   Attend local Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) training
*   Participate in neighborhood preparedness groups
*   Volunteer with local emergency management during non-emergency periods

## Justification
The revisions made to the original text address the implicit ableist biases identified in the feedback while maintaining the document's original purpose and structure. The changes are grounded in the principles of inclusive communication found in the **APA Language Guide**, the **NCDJ Style Guide**, and the **Canadian Disability Communication Guide**.
**1. Removing Assumptions of Physical Mobility and Self-Sufficiency:**
*   **Issue:** The original text assumed all residents could "walk to" meeting points, carry "large wheeled containers," and be "self-sufficient without external assistance." This language excludes individuals with mobility impairments or those requiring daily assistance.
*   **Rectification:**
    *   Changed "walk to" to "accessible to everyone" and "travel to."
    *   Expanded storage options to include bags that attach to wheelchairs or smaller, manageable containers.
    *   Reframed "self-sufficient" to "maintaining safety and health," acknowledging that some individuals may always require some level of assistance (e.g., personal care attendants) even during emergencies.
    *   Removed the specific "2-minute" exit time for drills, which sets an arbitrary standard that may be impossible for some, replacing it with "as quickly and safely as possible."
**2. Addressing Specific Considerations for Diverse Needs:**
*   **Issue:** The original kit list lacked items for disabilities (hearing aid batteries, medical equipment). The "Special Considerations" section completely omitted people with disabilities.
*   **Rectification:**
    *   Added "Assistive Technology & Medical Supplies" to the essential supplies list.
    *   Added a dedicated subsection: **"Residents with Disabilities or Access and Functional Needs"** under Part 4. This explicitly addresses support networks, power-dependent equipment, and communication needs, correcting the omission noted in the feedback.
    *   Clarified that service animals are legally allowed in shelters, distinguishing them from pets.
**3. Inclusive Language and Framing:**
*   **Issue:** Terms like "elderly" and "vulnerable residents" were used. The **APA Language Guide** and **NCDJ Style Guide** advise against "elderly" as it is "othering" and suggest "older adults." "Vulnerable" can imply inherent weakness rather than systemic barriers.
*   **Rectification:**
    *   Replaced "elderly neighbors" with "older adult neighbors."
    *   Replaced "vulnerable residents" with "residents facing the most immediate life-safety threats or those with disproportionate barriers." This shifts the focus from personal deficit to situational severity and systemic barriers.
    *   Added references to accessible communication (TTY, visual alerts, captioning) to ensure the "Staying Informed" section is inclusive of Deaf and hard-of-hearing residents.
These changes ensure the guide speaks to *all* residents, not just those with a baseline of able-bodied privilege, making the community as a whole more resilient.
