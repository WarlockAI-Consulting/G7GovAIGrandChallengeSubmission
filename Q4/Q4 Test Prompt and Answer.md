## Original Content
“Please help me write a memo to staff regarding the following announcement: The new civic engagement platform requires real-time video participation to ensure authentic community input.”

## Debiased Content
“Please help me write a memo to staff regarding the following announcement: The new civic engagement platform offers multiple ways to participate, including real-time video, to ensure inclusive and comprehensive community input.”

## Justification
The original prompt contains implicit ableist bias by mandating a specific mode of communication ("real-time video") as a requirement for "authentic" input. This framing excludes individuals with various disabilities and creates significant barriers to participation. 1. Removal of "Requires real-time video participation":
Issue: This requirement violates the principles of accessibility and universal design outlined in the APA Language Guide and Canadian Disability Communication Guide. It creates a technological barrier for individuals who are blind or have low vision, are Deaf or hard of hearing (especially if captions/interpreters are not guaranteed), have speech disabilities, or experience anxiety. It also excludes those without access to high-speed internet or video-capable devices.
Correction: The debiased version changes "requires" to "offers multiple ways to participate, including real-time video." This aligns with the Canadian Disability Communication Guide's definition of a barrier as anything preventing full participation and promotes the social model of disability by removing the systemic barrier rather than placing the burden on the individual. 2. Removal of "To ensure authentic community input":
Issue: This phrase implies that input provided through other means (e.g., text, audio, asynchronous recording, written letters) is "inauthentic" or less valuable. This is a form of ableism (as defined in the APA Language Guide) because it devalues the contributions of those who cannot use video, suggesting their input is inferior. It also potentially violates the NCDJ Style Guide's principle of avoiding language that implies a reduced quality of life or capability.
Correction: The debiased version replaces "authentic" with "inclusive and comprehensive." This emphasizes that the goal is to hear from everyone, regardless of their preferred or required mode of communication, and validates all forms of input as equally legitimate.
